# Threats Manager Studio sources

## Definition

Threats Manager Studio is a reference implementation for Threats Manager Platform.  
While it is not available as Open Source, because it is based on various commercial components, it is freely downloadable from its [main web site](https://threatsmanager.com). Threats Manager Studio and its optional Extension Libraries can be used on all contexts and for all purposes for free, under a very permissive license. 
The sources provided here are partial and are provided for reference purposes only. They miss some components, like the icons, because they cannot be redistributed. Moreover, building the sources would require owning a license of commercial third party libraries, including
