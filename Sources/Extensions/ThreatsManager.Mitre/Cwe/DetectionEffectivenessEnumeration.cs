/// <summary>
/// The DetectionEffectivenessEnumeration simple type defines the different levels of effectiveness that a detection method may have in detecting an associated weakness. The value "High" is used to describe a method that succeeds frequently and does not result in many false reports. The value "Moderate" is used to describe a method that is applicable to multiple circumstances, but it may not have complete coverage of the weakness, or it may result in a number of incorrect reports. The "SOAR Partial" value means that according to SOAR this method can be cost-effective for partial coverage of the objective. The value "Opportunistic" is used to describe a method that does not directly target the weakness but may still succeed by chance, rather than in a reliable manner. The value "Limited" is used to describe a method that may be useful in limited circumstances, only applicable to a subset of potential instances of a given weakness type, requires training/customization, or gives limited visibility. Even in its limited capacity, this may be part of a good defense in depth strategy. The value "None" is used to describe a method that is highly unlikely to work. However, it may be included in an entry to emphasize common, yet incorrect, methods that developers might introduce.
