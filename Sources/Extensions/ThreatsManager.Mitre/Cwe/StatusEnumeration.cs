/// <summary>
/// The StatusEnumeration simple type defines the different status values that an entity (view, category, weakness) can have. A value of Deprecated refers to an entity that has been removed from CWE, likely because it was a duplicate or was created in error. A value of Obsolete is used when an entity is still valid but no longer is relevant, likely because it has been superseded by a more recent entity.  A value of Incomplete means that the entity does not have all important elements filled, and there is no guarantee of quality.  A value of Draft refers to an entity that has all important elements filled, and critical elements such as Name and Description are reasonably well-written; the entity may still have important problems or gaps.  A value of Usable refers to an entity that has received close, extensive review, with critical elements verified.  A value of Stable indicates that all important elements have been verified, and the entry is unlikely to change significantly in the future. Note that the quality requirements for Draft and Usable status are very resource-intensive to accomplish, while some Incomplete and Draft entries are actively used by the general public; so, this status enumeration might change in the future.
