# Threats Manager Platform Core libraries and SDK

## Definition

Threats Manager Platform is a Threat Modeling solution that has been designed to be rehostable, extendable and flexible.
It has been designed and implemented by a group of experienced Threat Modelers, to satisfy the needs of their day by day job, and it has been evolved over the time to cover additional scenarios.
Threats Manager Platform is the reference implementation of the Threat Modeling vNext vision, discussed in <https://simoneonsecurity.com>.

The code included in this Repo is to be also available as part of a complete Threat Modeling tool, called Threats Manager Studio, which implements the Windows Desktop experience. That tool along with a number of Extensions is available from <https://threatsmanager.com>.
Threats Manager Studio and the Windows Desktop Extensions are also available as Open Source. You may not be able to build them, though, because they are based on various commercial components which cannot be delivered as part of this distribution. Still, Threats Manager Studio and its Extensions are freely downloadable and usable in all contexts, under a very permissive license. 
Threats Manager Studio represents both a reference implementation of the Threats Manager Platform and a tool you can adopt for your Threat Modeling activities.
