# Threats Manager Studio sources

## Definition

Threats Manager Studio is a reference implementation for Threats Manager Platform.  
It is available as Open Source, with the same license of all the rest of the sources (MIT). You may not be able to build Threats Manager Studio and its accompanying Extensions, though, because they are based on various commercial components which cannot be delivered as part of this distribution. In any case, you can freely download them from their [main web site](https://threatsmanager.com). Threats Manager Studio and its optional Extension Libraries can be used on all contexts and for all purposes for free, under a very permissive license. 
The sources provided here are partial and are provided for reference purposes only. They miss some components, like the icons, because they cannot be redistributed. Moreover, building the sources would require owning a license of commercial third party libraries, including
